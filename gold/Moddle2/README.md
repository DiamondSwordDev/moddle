Moddle2
=======

Moddle is an open-source Minecraft launcher and modpack creation framework.  Its purpose is to make modpack creation a quick and easy process for anyone and everyone who wants to make their own modpack.  It also provides a simple and straightforward method of modpack distribution by serving as a standard platform for building modpacks.  Moddleâ€™s core libraries are also completely available to and for anyone who wants to take advantage of their functionalities and integrate them into their own Minecraft launcher!

Moddle2 is our from-scratch rewrite of the orignal Python code of Moddle.  This should, hopefully, mean less bugs and critical errors that cannot be resolved because of their inherentness in the distribution platform.  Moddle2 is written in the C# language, targeting the .NET Framework.  It is, as such, Windows-only, but we may be able to port to the Mono Framework at some point in the future.
