moddle
======

A simple, easy to use, mod launcher with a build-in cache.

(I really need to write a better README.)

This version uses and includes [SharpZipLib](http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sharpziplib/), which is avilable for free use under the terms on the above linked page. It will be removed eventually, though, when we move to pure Python.
